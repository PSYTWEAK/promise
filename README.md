# Promise

Promise is an experimental solidity contract which aims to give traders more flexibility by allowing them to make promises about future trades.

# Example

Bob wants to sell his Ethereum at the current price of $1000 but doesn't want to make the trade today. He executes a promise with the Prom and is given the ability to sell his ethereum for $1000 in 30 days.
